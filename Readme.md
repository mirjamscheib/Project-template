## Abstract (Miri)
<!-- (50-60 words) -->

## Research Questions (Mirj)
Based on the data from the Posmo Project App from **xy students** we attempt to answer the following research questions: 

- What type of travel mode is the most common?  
- Does rain impact travel distance or travel mode? 
- Does distance impact travel mode?  
- Average travelling distance from home per day? Higher, lower or same on the weekends vs during week? 
- When riding the bycile or walking by foot -> avoidance of main roads? 
- Does the main location of a person have an impact on the primary travel mode (e.g. central point with a 100m diameter, classified in city, urban, land etc) 
- Does have age/university/status (student, teacher etc.) an impact on travelled distance/primary travel mode?

## Results / products (Mirj)
<!-- What do you expect, anticipate? -->

## Data (Mirj)
- **xy students**
- tracking period (**date from xy to xy**) 
- travel modes available (car, bicycle, foot, train, other....) 

The .csv data set contains **xy trips/ tracked locations** with the following attributes: 
-   **user_id:** entails the ID of the user (student) (type: *character*)
-   **datetime:** date and time when a position of a user/student is tracked (type: *datetime*) 
-   **weekday:** abbreviated name of the weekday (e.g. Mon = Monday) (type: *character*)
-   **place_name:** names of a place, in which a user/student is for a specific time (type: *character*)
-   **transport_mode:** the type of transport used by a user/student (type: *character*)
-   **lon_x/lat_y:** coordinates of the user at a specific time (type: *numeric*)
<!-- What data will you use? Will you require additional context data? Where do you get this data from? Do you already have all the data? -->

## Analytical concepts (Miri)
<!-- Which analytical concepts will you use? What conceptual movement spaces and respective modelling approaches of trajectories will you be using? What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

## R concepts (Mirj)
<!-- Which R concepts, functions, packages will you mainly use. What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

## Risk analysis (Mirj)
<!-- What could be the biggest challenges/problems you might face? What is your plan B? -->

## Questions? (Mirj + Miri)
<!-- Which questions would you like to discuss at the coaching session? -->
