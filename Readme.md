## Abstract 
<!-- (50-60 words) -->

## Research Questions
Based on the data from the Posmo Project App from xy students we attempt to answer the following research questions: 

- What type of travel mode is the most common?  
- Does rain impact travel distance or travel mode? 
- Does distance impact travel mode?  
- Average travelling distance from home per day? Higher, lower or same on the weekends vs during week? 
- When riding the bycile or walking by foot -> avoidance of main roads? 
- Does the main location of a person have an impact on the primary travel mode (e.g. central point with a 100m diameter, classified in city, urban, land etc) 
- Does have age/university/status (student, teacher etc.) an impact on travelled distance/primary travel mode?
